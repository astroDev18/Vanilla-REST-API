# Vanilla-REST-API
A vanilla REST api I built in Node.js from scratch without using any frameworks to help me better understand how frameworks like Express work.

You can manage the JSON with Get, Create, Update, and Delete features. Here's an example of each below:

Using the GET functionality to display either all products, or a single product.

Using the Create functionality to add a new item to the JSON List. You don't need to add the item ID due to it using a unique ID generator for each item.
